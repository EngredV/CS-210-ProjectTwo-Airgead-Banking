# CS-210-ProjectTwo-Airgead-Banking

### •	**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**


The Airgead Banking (a financial company) Project Two focused on developing a program that helps users to calculate and visualize their investments and their growth over time. This program was designed to allow users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years that they plan to invest. The program would then generate reports showing how their investment grows year by year based on all of the information that the user inputted into the program. In the end, this program’s/project’s goal is to help the user understand how compound interest impacts their investments, thus helping users make more informed financial decisions. 


### •	**What did you do particularly well?**


One of the things that I believe I did particularly well was the logic for calculating compound interest accurately and efficiently. I made sure that the calculations for the user’s investment growth reflected both with and without monthly deposits. Additionally, I ensure I did so with accurate performance while also displaying the information in a clear, user-friendly format.


### •	**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**


One of the areas that I believe could be enhanced is that of optimization. Even though the code performs well for its intended purposes, the use of more efficient algorithms or optimizing the data structures would be ideal. I believe it to be ideal because it could significantly improve performance, especially when the program has to handle large datasets (which might be the case with a bank after all). As for making the code more resilient to user errors and more secure by preventing potential misuse, the way to do this is to add a more robust input validation such as only accepting positive numbers for the input, and error handling to manage unexpected situations such as invalid data types inputs or division by zero. 


### •	**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**


The pieces of the code that I found most challenging to write were implementing the compound interest calculations in a way that it accurately reflected the effects it had on the monthly deposits. I found it to be most challenging because it required a clear understanding of how to apply the compound interest formulas over multiple periods within a year, and also accounting for both the principal and additional contributions as well. I overcame this challenge by reviewing financial mathematics concepts in order to understand the formula for the compound interest and how to break it down into monthly calculations. I also used the resources listed by the professor for the assignment and the program Sense that was really helpful before doing the project.


### •	**What skills from this project will be particulary transferable to other projects or course work?**


The skills from this project that I would be able to transfer onto other projects or course work are modular programming, mathematical calculations in code, input validation and error handling, and finally user experience considerations. All of these will also be helpful for my future in the work field as well since they all include breaking down the code into functions or methods that can perform specific tasks, algorithm implementation, thorough input checks and error management, and finally, structing the output in a user-friendly way that helps users better visualize and therefore process the information.


### •	**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**


I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by having a clear code structure which focused on using functions with descriptive names, consistent formatting and naming conventions which involved adhering to consistent coding styles such as indentation and naming conventions for variables/functions, commenting and documentation which focused on adding comments throughout the code in order to explain what is going on and the purpose of each function, and finally modular design, which focused on using separate functions for the calculations and output formatting as this makes it much mor easier to modify one part of the program without it having any effect on the others ( it also allows the addition of new features).
